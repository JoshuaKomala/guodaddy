## Team GuoDaddy Proposal


### Project: InstaMap

Taking great pictures is all about location. InstaMap helps you find the hottest locations to hone your art (and nab that perfect profile picture).

### Feedback:

> Emily Yew: "good idea to start off, though might want to consider other factors that make an Instagram post popular
perhaps consider the category that the picture goes into? The image can be a food picture, a great location, or it could be outside of these categories. Controversial posts etc can also be popular. How would you differentiate?"


> Alok: "I really liked the ideas by Bahari Hasjim. If you could combine the ideas behind both the storyboards together, that would be something that I would use :) "


Description of your proposed projectâ€™s features. You can add UI
sketches here if you want, but no need for a full paper prototype.

  - Make sure we are able to communicate with the backend and display it to the user.
  - Help tie in backend services with databases
