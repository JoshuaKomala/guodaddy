# Milestone 9



## Core Functionality
 
From last week until now, we've put in a ton of work to make the app based entirely on real, from-an-actual-api data, rather than dummy data like we used last week. We linked up the Google Maps and Flickr apis, and the result is that not only can we see pins on the map for each picture that was taken, but we can click on each of those pins and see the picture itself. 

Additionally, the pins now reload every time the bounds of the map are changed. For example, if the user zooms in from looking at the whole of California, to just looking at San Diego, the pins will disappear and just pins for San Diego will be loaded (resulting in much more photos for that area).
